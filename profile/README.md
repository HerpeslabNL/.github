# Welcome to the HerpeslabNL GitHub page!

## About us

We are a research group at Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Our lab is led by Dr. Georges M.G.M. Verjans and we investigate the virus and host interactions involved in immune control and pathogenesis of human herpesvirus infections.

We rely on a combination of in silico, in vitro and ex vivo techniques to study the molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus infections. We are particularly interested in the role of the immune system in controlling herpesvirus infections and the mechanisms by which herpesviruses evade immune control. We also study the role of herpesviruses in the pathogenesis of ocular and neurological diseases. This GitHub page contains code and data for some of our projects.

For more details on our team, research projects, collaboration network and publications please see our [lab website](http://www.herpeslab.nl). We welcome interested students and researchers to contact us about potential collaborations, internships, and PhD projects.
